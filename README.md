# HOME NETWORK AUTOMATION

The purpose of this project is to automate the setup of my home network using ansible. These include the setup of an OPNSense Gateway and multiple Mikrotik Cloud Router Switches.

Please see the wiki for the project [here](https://drinferno2001.github.io/HOME_NETWORK_AUTOMATION_WIKI/).

It should go into depth on the project setup and the work I've completed for it so far.
